# knights-tour
Knightâ€™s Tour is a sequence of valid moves of a knight on a chessboard in such a way that the knight covers all the squares on the board. This is a Hamiltonian path problem in computer science which is NP-complete. In this project, I compare the time complexities of Knight's Tour while implementing i) Backtracking, and ii) Warnsdorff's heuristic.
